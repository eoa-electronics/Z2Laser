# **Z2Laser**

---

### **Description**
Z2Laser is a simple Java-based tool to convert Z movements in your G-Code files to Laser on or off commands. <br>
This tool is useful when using Engraving Software which doesn't support Laser on its own, but you still want to use it. <br>
This was developed for FlatCAM, so you can Laser-Etch your PCB trace isolations, instead of having to mill it (more about that at our website [eoa-electronics.de](https://eoa-electronics)).

### **Usage**
This tool is pretty self-explanatory, but here's a quick guide: <br>
1. Start the Tool and open up your G-Code file.
2. (If you want to change anything manually first, do it in the integrated editor.)
3. Type in all your G-Code parameters in the Fields.
4. Click the ```Convert``` button and wait for the tool to do its job.
5. (Maybe check your file, especially the beginning and end, and if you want to make some manual changes)
6. Save the newly generated G-Code file wherever you want.
7. Start engraving!
